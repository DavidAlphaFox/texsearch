(*
The data structure used for the index is a modified bktree.
Each tree node contains a single document and its associated latex strings.
The children of the node are stored according to their distance (index_dist) from the node.

The left_edit_distance satisfies the triangle inequality: for any a,b,c
  left_edit_dist a c <= left_edit_dist a b + left_edit_dist b c
From this we can derive:
  min_j (query_dist query b_j) >= min_i (query_dist query c_i) - min_i max_j (left_edit_dist b_j c_i)
Where i and j range over all the equations in the documents b and c
This is the crucial fact that allows efficient searching within the tree.

The search structure tracks the progress of a search through a tree.
The search will eventually return every document node whose distance to the query is less than the cutoff.

search.unsearched stores tree nodes which have yet to be searched.
Tree nodes in search.unsearched.(i) are guaranteed not to contain any document nodes with distance < i from the query.

search.min_dist tracks the smallest non-empty index in search.unsearches,
so every document node remaining in the search has distance >= min_dist.

search.results stores matches for the query.
search.results.(i) contains matches with dist i from the query.

search.safe_results stores the number of results with distance < min_dist.
no as-yet-unsearched results will match more closely than these
so if the number of results required is less than search.safe_results it is safe to stop searching
