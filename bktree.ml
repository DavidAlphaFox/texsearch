(* 
A quasi-metric space is a set of points and a distance function satisfying:
  For all a. dist a a = 0
  For all a,b. dist a b >= 0
  For all a,b,c. dist a c <= dist a b + dist b c

The data structure used for the index is a bk-cover-tree.
The tree organises a quasi-metric space by successive subdivisions of the space.
Each tree node contains a single point and its children are arranged by distance to that point.
This structure allows for efficient searching by any 'query : node -> int' which satisfies:
  For all a. query a >= 0
  For all a, b. query b - query a <= dist a b

A simple example of such a query is the function:
  let query a = dist q a
for some node q.
